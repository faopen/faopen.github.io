/**
 * Pages
 * ---
 *
 * This directory contains module Pages.
 * A page is primary construct (a scaffold) onto which
 * other components and helpers are placed.
 *
 * Pages are directly linked with Router. Essentially,
 * each module or subModule can have it's own page and
 * own unique url route.
 *
 * At least 1 page is mandatory since that will act as
 * landing or primary page for the module. This page
 * should be called `MainPage.tsx`.
 *
 * 1 page is added as a sample. It can be edited or
 * replaced as per requirement.
